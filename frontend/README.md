# PRISM Frontend (stub)

This folder will host a minimal React + TypeScript UI with the following structure:

- `src/` – application source
  - `api/` – lightweight client for backend calls
  - `components/` – prompt form, results grid, metrics summary
  - `views/` – top-level page composition

Backend work is prioritized first. The UI will be added after the core evaluation pipeline stabilizes.
